# Terminal-Based-Real-Estate-App
### Overview
The Terminal-Based Real Estate App is a simplified command-line application developed in C for managing real estate transactions. This application supports various functionalities such as user registration, login, house advertisements, and a recommendation system for pricing. It also includes an administrative module to promote users and manage advertisements.

### How It Works

## Architecture Overview
The Terminal-Based Real Estate App is structured into several key components: user management, house advertisements, administrative functions, and utility functions. Each component interacts with others to provide a seamless user experience.

## Key Components

1. **User Management**:
    - **Registration & Login**: Users can create accounts and log in using their credentials. The system distinguishes between regular users and admins.
    - **User Roles**: Users have different roles (e.g., regular user, admin), with admins having additional privileges such as promoting users and managing advertisements.

2. **House Advertisements**:
    - **Browsing Ads**: Users can browse through a list of house advertisements, each with detailed information about the property.
    - **Adding Ads**: Logged-in users can post new house advertisements by providing details such as location, size, and features.
    - **Price Recommendation**: The system suggests a price for new listings based on the provided details and market trends.

3. **Advanced Filtering**:
    - Users can filter house listings based on various criteria such as location, price range, size, and more. This helps in narrowing down the search to find suitable properties.

4. **Administrative Functions**:
    - **User Promotion**: Admins can promote regular users to special roles, granting them additional privileges.
    - **Ad Management**: Admins can enhance the visibility of certain advertisements and manage the overall content on the platform.



By following this structured approach, the Terminal-Based Real Estate App provides a robust and user-friendly platform for managing real estate transactions through a terminal interface.
